SWIFT INFERRING TYPES AND CLOSURES

This is an introductory post for Swift begginers about type inference and it's benefits in code readability and expressivity.

As is known, Swift is a strong typed language, and it helps a lot in readability of the code. We'll see the benefits applied to closures. The general closure expression syntax has this general form:

{% highlight objective-c %}
    {(parameters) -> returnType in
        statements
    }
{% endhighlight %}

Closures in Swift accepts constant parameters, variable parameters, inout parameters, but default values cannot be provided. They're very used in the fashion functional functions map, reduce, filter, sort...

And here is where Swift type inference is very useful. Take a simple sorting example of sorting an array of numbers. In his most verbose syntax, it look like this:

{% highlight objective-c %}
    let array = [13,3,4,1,230,68,150]
    let ordered = array.sort({(s1: Int, s2: Int) -> Bool in
        return s1 > s2
    })
{% endhighlight %}

The first type inference, and the most obvious one, is the parameter types. The sorting method is being called on an array of Int, so the argument must be a function og type (Int, Int) -> Bool. This means we don't need it. And because all the types are inferred, the return arrow and the parenthesis can also be ommited:

{% highlight objective-c %}
    let array = [13,3,4,1,230,68,150]
    let ordered = array.sort({s1, s2 in
        return s1 > s2
    })
{% endhighlight %}

We can express it as a inline closure:

{% highlight objective-c %}
    let array = [13,3,4,1,230,68,150]
    let ordered = array.sort({s1, s2 in return s1 > s2})
{% endhighlight %}

In a single-expression closure like this one, the closure can return the result without the return keyword:

{% highlight objective-c %}
    let array = [13,3,4,1,230,68,150]
    let ordered = array.sort({s1, s2 in s1 > s2})
{% endhighlight %}

Swift automatically provides argument names in closures, which can be used to refer the closure values. Naes provided are $0, $1 and so on. If you use this shorthand names provided by Swift, you can omit the parameter names in the closure. And ommitting the parameter names allow us to ommit the in keyword also:

{% highlight objective-c %}
    let array = [13,3,4,1,230,68,150]
    let ordered = array.sort({$0 > $1})
{% endhighlight %}

And finally, because the > and < operators are defined as a function that takes to parameters and returns a Bool, that exactly matches what sort() method expects, so the shortest version ends like this:

{% highlight objective-c %}
    let array = [13,3,4,1,230,68,150]
    let ordered = array.sort(>)
{% endhighlight %}


The change from the first version to this one it's pretty nice to me!
